# Census Income Prediction using Adult Dataset

This repository contains project for predicting income levels using the Adult dataset. The Adult dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains demographic information about individuals such as age, education, occupation, etc., and a target variable indicating whether the individual's income exceeds $50K per year.

## Models Implemented

- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier

## Files Included

- Dataset/: Contains the dataset files.
- Models/: Models saved as pickle files.
- MoodelComparison.ipynb : Results and evaluation metrics for the models.
- Other notebooks : Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.

## Usage

- To train and evaluate the Random Forest model, please refer to the 'RandomForestModel.ipynb' notebook. This notebook contains code for training the Random Forest Classifier using the     Adult dataset and evaluating its performance.

- To train and evaluate the Naive Bayes model, please refer to the 'NaiveBayesModel.ipynb notebook. This notebook contains code for training the Naive Bayes Classifier using the Adult      dataset and evaluating its performance.

## Results

- Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 86%.
- Naive Bayes achieved an accuracy of 81%.
